	<p> Hi, good day! I'm Reichelle Remo, 21  years old currently living at 002 Quezon Ave St. Pob. 5 Sariaya, Quezon. I was born on August 30, 1999. My mother’s name is Lucila Remo which is a housewife while my father is Reynaldo Remo who works as a driver and a farmer. I do have one sibling, my sister Leianne Remo that is currently studying BSHM at Colegio Sto. de Cristo De Burgos . When my grandmother is alive she always telling me that I should pursue being a teacher that I will be a good teacher. Even my old high school classmates are expecting that I will be a math teacher.  But teaching is not my passion, even though I do like teaching my classmates when it comes to math in high school, and also today when my classmates in programming are having struggles on doing their programs I’m always willing to help them to be the best of my ability. It is heartwarming every time I share my knowledge and they learn something from me. </p><br>

	<p>It is so fascinating every time I took photos of the breathtaking art of nature. Nature inspires and provides a never-ending learning experience! The process of keeping visual nature photos is a path.  It’s not about creating a finished product or a pretty picture.  My photos are a reflection of curiosity and discovery. My observation has improved – I find myself specifically seeking out details to capture them on the fly or to write them down later.  My knowledge base is more dimensional; not only have I learned more, but my emotional connection to nature has also become more specific and I have a deeper sense of how individual parts fit into the whole.

	<p>Few hobbies relax the mind and soothe the hungry soul in quite the way that baking does. Baking for me means a lot of things! It’s also therapeutic, I love sharing my baking, and the warmth it brings to my soul. There’s nothing better than whipping up a loaf of banana bread and the aroma it scents the home with. Baking to me is nostalgic. It reminds me to slow down and plan out recipes. Besides being an obvious means to an end (a baked good), the act of baking is a form of myself expression. I create what I want to create, however little or magnificent that baked good may be.
 It’s not just about baking cookies, it’s about the joy and calm that come with it. How profound that a hobby can be a form of therapy.

	<p>I studied Elementary at Manuel Luis Quezon Elementary School and High School at St. Francis High School. Elementary and high school days is like a lost soul, I keep on searching for something, something that could fit me, something that every student have, and that is a friend. I grew up having temporary friends but did not stay permanently. I envy those persons who had a friend from elementary or high school that stays up until they get old. I’m a loner way back then, I prefer sitting in one corner of a room silently listening to the lessons of the teacher. I think I don’t have a friend because of that attitude because in those days students prefer to explore and discover things that they don’t know, but me? I just go straight to the house after school, no side trips just an ordinary student.</p><br>

	<p>I’m a consistent honor student when I was in elementary I don’t know how I got there without studying out home, it’s all a stock knowledge that I learned inside the school. I graduated elementary at the rank of top 9 in our batch.  When I reached high school that is where I realized the meaning of the importance of having a review especially when the exam is waving. On my 1st year, high school 1st quarterly exam a teacher caught me cheating on my seatmate due to having no idea what to answer on those questions. I found it very embarrassing and that scenario thought me that the life of a high school student is not the same as an elementary student. I graduated high school as an average student, with a grade of 90 in math and 76 in science in 4th-year high school. With an award of perfect attendance.</p><br>

	<p>After graduating High school I’m still confused about what course should I take in college and I still don’t know what kind of work I want in the future. So I choose the course that they want. I took a 2 years course which is hotel and Restaurant Services.</p>

	<p>Adjusting to college life is difficult. In addition to new social challenges, college studies often require a different skill set for those transitioning from high school. Time management and test anxiety often impact new students. Students also benefit from learning new study techniques and how to maximize their strengths. College life prepares you for all of this. It is a perfect blend of joy and hardships. You meet different people, you interact with them, you learn about their cultures and grow as a person. You will understand how to talk to different people, how to judge their behavior, thus helping you with important life skills.
	You learn to sit through a boring lecture; you try to cope up with the surprisingly strenuous syllabus, and you have the opportunity to learn from some great research minds. Academia, as they say, never lets you go free. People might try to motivate you by telling that you need to study only through your school years and chill during college life, but that isn’t true.</p><br>

	<p>Studying the course that you don’t like or just forced by your family is not that easy. It’s like forcing your mind and body to work on something that you don’t like or know. In the first semester of college, I find it boring since it is more about lectures on how the hospitality industry works. Our major at that time is cookery which is not I’m into. We had NCII in cookery after that semester and I felt sorry for my cooking dash's that burned my classmate's hand. I passed the NCII without still having a passion for cooking. Few semesters had past and one major subject caught my attention and it is Bartending. I find it cool to mix some drinks to create a piece that suits the taste of the customers. Flairtending the practice of bartenders entertaining guests, clientele, or audiences with the manipulation of bar tools and liquor bottles in tricky, dazzling ways that cause bruises to my arms which I find entertaining every time I tried to throw a bottle and catch it after.</p><br>

	<p>I graduated with unexpected awards which I don’t know at that time that awards do still exist in college. I passed the bartending NCII which is a prestigious NCII here in quezon because only few passed on that exam. Because of that, I received Best in Bartending Award and an Academic Excellence Award for not having a grade below 2.0 or 86%.</p>

	<p>My most recent sermon was entitled, "Now We Wait." I considered the story of King Jehoshaphat in 2 Chronicles chapter 20 and Jesus in the boat with his disciples in Mark 4. </p><br>

	<p>In the first story, the king and the people were facing a dangerous and large enemy, so they cried out to God in prayer, asking for help, for safety, for mercy, and verse 12 of that chapter ends with these two powerful and timely statements - "For we are powerless against this great multitude that is coming against us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you." </p><br>

	<p>In the storm story told in Mark 4, the disciples assault their slumbering Savior and ask him this question: "Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?" </p><br>

	<p>I intentionally ended the Scripture readings in the middle of those stories. In the awkward and painful pause between the prayer and the answer. Between the question and the response. Because isn't that where we spend a lot of our time? Facing great multitudes that we have no power to overcome.Unsure of where to turn or what to do. Wondering if Jesus is still asleep in our nearly-swamped boats.  Asking - sometimes aloud, but mostly silently, urgently, painfully, between clenched jaws -  "Don't you care that we are perishing???" Looking around, we wonder - Does anyone care? Anyone at all? </p><br>

	<p>After graduating with a two years degree in college I started to work in Laguna. I didn’t pursue my degree because even though I enjoy it, the Hospitality industry is not in my heart that could bring to me happiness. So first I applied in call centers which I failed multiple times due to stuttering because of nervousness that I’m not used to talking to people in public. It lowers down my self-confidence and I even ask myself, where do I belong? Where I could find work that not only can help me financially but where can also enjoy. One day, one of my friends asked me if I would like to join her to apply in a semiconductor company, I get hired on that day.  I accepted the job without knowing what kind of job position is waiting for me there. I became a Quality Assurance where we check the item and making sure that it is 100% defect-free before shipping it to the customer or client. Working in a semiconductor opens my mind to the real world; how they treated every individual depends on their position. That it is not how high your grade was when you are studying, but it is about how skilled you are when already in the field. Because of that, I asked myself, are you satisfied in your life? On your achievements?. Before I apply for any work I said to myself that when I able to save money I will go back to school again and pursue the course that I do want.

	<p>One accomplishment changes my life hard. Opens my mind to a brighter future that might await me. In May 2018 I applied for the civil service exam, I told myself if I passed this exam I will make sure that next year I will pursue my studies, even though I will become a working student I will accept it. I work hard for it, a minimum of 8 hrs to 16 hours of work, and after that, I review and self-study for the upcoming civil service exam. Knowing my strengths and weaknesses leads me to where should I focus. I do love math which is my strength then I’m not that good when it comes to vocabulary and there where I decided to focus. The examination day comes; on August 12, 2018, I did my best on that exam even though I got a headache while taking the exam. Answering 170 items in 3 hours is not that easy, on the last few questions I did not answer it because the time is up. I lost hope of passing because of that incident. After two months (October) the exam results were out and I’m nervous if I would see my name on the passers' name. Luckily I passed the exam, I felt overflowing feelings that I can’t explain. After a month I saw a post on Facebook that CSTC gives free education to the students. God does have a better plan for each person, and I believe in His plans for me. Until now I can’t forget that day, the day that changes my life differently.  </p>

	<p>Fortunately, my thirst for knowledge did not come to an end when I was at school. I was passionate about mathematics and technology. This passion helped me gain profound knowledge in these areas, and I was admitted to college. Today, I’m currently studying in CSTC Sariaya as a 2nd-year BSIT student, it might be that course that I want but God leads me here and I feel very happy about it. After enrolling in BSIT I still don’t know my path but when I learned how to code I already know what job I want in the future, and it is to be a programmer. I enjoy every second I spend when I code. I didn’t even think how long I was facing the laptop just to accomplish the output that I want to achieve. In coding, I apply my knowledge in math and it enhances my logical skills to answer every error that I encountered. </p><br>

	<p>
	I have come to believe that two main factors determine success. First of all is a person’s own determination and will to succeed. Are you ready to make sacrifices to achieve your goal, like working and studying at the same time? Are you prepared to recover after failure and proceed to your goal again? Without strong internal motivation, it is nearly impossible to become successful. Equally important is the support of people around me. Being determined to succeed does not mean alienating everyone and stepping on other people in order to achieve your goal. On the contrary, success is about recognizing your weaknesses and accepting support from people who genuinely want to help you. For instance, if it were not for my parents’ support of my educational endeavors, I would perhaps not be attending school today.
